You need to get A NATION ADRIFT for you and your family, children, grandchildren, church, youth group, and it will help you counteract some of the revisionist history that\'s being taught in the schools and colleges of the United States."  --Marlin Maddoux, Radio Talk Show Host"Since the Christian basis of so much of American history has been deleted or rewritten, A NATION ADRIFT is an answer to our yearnings!  Though rich with a great number and variety of visuals, the video\'s strongest point is that, in only 90 minutes, a viewer can see and hear enough new and significant information to all but obviate the need to even take a U.S. history class!  Every American should see this video because it contains information that will probably never again be presented in the secular classrooms of this "nation adrift."  --Dale Mason, Gospel Communications"This video has a vital and timely message for Americans.  With its excellent production techniques, I expect it to have a major impact on audiences wherever it is shown."  --D. James Kennedy, Ph.D., Coral Ridge MinistriesA NATION ADRIFT is an excellent video presentation of the moral and spiritual crisis in America and the urgent necessity of recovering the truth about America\'s Christian heritage and God\'s plan for our nation.  It is a call to action for America\'s Christians for pleading with God to bring a revival before it is too late."  --Peter Marshall, Author and Historian'}

To make up for the fact that her students are in school on  Christmas Eve, the local schoolteacher hires the magician Professor Hinkle to entertain the kids.

Oatmeal? Frosty!), and when the hat blows onto it, the snowman comes to life. Professor Hinkle decides he wants the hat back so he can make money off of its newfound magical properties, but the kids want to save Frosty. When the temperature starts to rise, a new problem threatens Frosty's existence. Karen, the leader of the children, comes up with a plan to save him: take him on a train to the North Pole, where it's always cold. With a cameo by Santa Claus and the promise of Frosty's return every year, this  story of life, death, and holiday cheer is glazed with the sweet frosting of  hope and happiness. A true holiday classic.--Andy Spletzer"}

When the  stowaways are discovered, a kindly "gypsy mama" takes them under her wing.  Curiously, neither child is missed until bedtime, allowing them a good head start and the beginnings of a performance career in a lion suit dubbed  "Madelito." The kids eventually get homesick and are tracked down by Pepito\'s  parents, Miss Clavel, and Madeline\'s class, but in the meantime there are  clowns, a strongman, an elephant, and plenty of catchy songs.--Kimberly  Heinrichs', 'title': 'Madeline: Gypsies [VHS]', 'price': 12.95, 'salesRank': {'Movies & TV': 529627}, 'imUrl': 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21Q7PHB8QSL.jpg', 'brand': '', 'categories': [['CDs & Vinyl', "Children's Music"], ['Movies & TV', 'Movies']]}

But while the old pals chat, the red-haired "smallest one" leaps onto the doll conveyor belt and before one can say "Oh, Madeline!" she is boxed up with the rest of the dolls and shipped off to a toy store. The mother of an ailing girl purchases her to lift her daughter\'s spirits, which, of course, the amazingly lifelike doll does.

The story, however, which elaborates on the popular Christmas song about a shepherd boy who plays his drum for the baby Jesus and makes the animals dance, is a little more tough-minded than you might expect. The kid begins the story as what we'd now call a neglected child, a surly urchin who says he hates all people. He's pulled back from the brink, first by learning to make music, and then by his encounter with the Christ child. The underlying message alone--that everybody has something worth contributing--qualifies the show for holiday-perennial status. The big-name voice performers, Jose Ferrer and Greer Garson (who narrates), may be a little too ponderous for the occasion, but the familiar cartoony tones of Paul Frees (aka Boris Badenov) and June Forey (aka Rocket J. Squirrel) help liven up the proceedings. It's only 23 minutes long, so it's worth a shot for younger children.--David Chute"}

The story: In the town of Beansboro, old Mr. Twitchell has invented an aerosol spray that can remove snow without the hassle of shoveling or plows. This frightens Frosty, who enlists the help of amateur magician Holly and her friend Charles to stop the old coot. Made in 1992,Frosty Returnshas an animation style that looks like a cross between the old Schoolhouse Rock and Peanuts cartoons, with voice talent that includes Jonathan Winters, Andrea Martin, Jan Hooks, Brian Doyle-Murray, and John Goodman as Frosty. The story may be divisive, pitting children against adults and a pro-snow contingent against anti-snow people, but the songs are catchy and the message is one that ultimately empowers kids.

He returns inUnderdog Vs. Simon Barsinister, a 40-minute marathon of three original, eccentric episodes ofThe Underdog Show. In the first, "Shrinking Water," Sweet Polly Purebred shrieks helplessly for the floppy-eared dynamo after Simon Barsinister, the series\' sparse-haired, swollen-eyed mad scientist, diabolically devises a way to shrink all the world\'s citizens into thumb-sized replicas of themselves. Predictably, Underdog swoops down to save the day, but not without a close call that requires the use of his Super Underdog Energy Pill. Polly is equally powerless in the second episode, "Vacuum Gun." Here, Barsinister sucks a crew of thugs into a magic vacuum in an attempt to form an army of criminal geniuses. Polly, inadvertently tangled up in the bad guys\' barbaric scheme, squeaks a few feeble "Help--ooh, helps" and--hip, hip, hip--away Underdog goes. Finally, "Simon Says" finds Barsinister concocting yet another world-domination scheme, this one in the form of a camera that turns people into pictures. Have no fear, though--Underdog is here. He uses a mirror to bounce the picture-making rays back onto Barsinister, creating a not-so-pretty picture out of him, at least until next time. Not just nostalgic grownups but children 5 and older are apt to stay tuned toThe Underdog Show. Its predictable, repetitive patterns (the airborne hero collides into a new, unforeseen obstruction at each episode\'s end, for instance) and simple story lines manage to never get tiresome.--Tammy La Gorce'}

Once that nasally heroic cry echoes from the clouds, you\'ll want to sit on the floor in your pajamas on Saturday morning and eat cereal in front of the TV. The three episodes on this 40-minute video are quintessential Underdog. In "Underdog vs. Overcat," the evil Overcat steals Earth\'s cows when Planet Felina\'s milk wells run dry. Sweet Polly Purebred is kidnapped to milk the cows, but Underdog rescues her and returns the cows to Earth. Overcat challenges Underdog to a fight, with the cows going to the winner. Underdog triumphs, Overcat is banished, and Underdog plants coconut trees on Felina so the cats will always have milk. No surprises, but it\'s cleverly written and animated nonetheless. Just try to resist a wry smile during "The Flying Sorcerers," when King Cup and his two sons force Sweet Polly to bake them 500 cakes. Forumulaic, yes, and thoroughly enjoyable for current and former children.--Patty Stuart'}

In the midst of pagan self-indulgence, Jesus challenged his disciples to deny themselves and follow him. Christians today must also have the courage to boldly live out Christ's message in a pagan society. Sardis - The Salt of the Earth. The apostle John used the example of Sardis, a city that overlooked its weak points and thereby enabled invading armies to conquer it, to warn Christians to be alert to their weakness so that they would not compromise their faith. Pergamum - Where Satan Lives. At this regional seat of Rome, the governor had 'the power of the sword' to determine life and death. John reminded Christians of this powerful, pagan city that Jesus alone-not the Roman governor-hold all power, including power of life and death. VIDEO TWO: Ephesus - The Mark of the Beast. In this wealthy, beautiful center of idolatry, Paul unashamedly proclaimed the truth of the Gospel. Like Paul and other Christians in Ephesus, we are to love one another and courageously live out the truth of Christ in a culture that is openly hostile toward him. Laodicea - Hot or Cold.

Video One 1. Innocent Blood -- Part 1 (Megiddo) When evil dominates society as it did at Megiddo, it's a wake-up call for Christians to fight for righteousness. 2. Innocent Blood -- Part 2 (Megiddo) 3. Who Is God? (Mount Carmel) In a fiery showdown with the prophets of Baal, Elijah confronted Israel with a choice: 'Whom will you serve?' Today, we must challenge our culture with the same questions. 4. The Wages of Sin (Lachish) What happened at Lachish issues warnings to Christians today. When God's values are ignored by the majority, even the righteous reap the consequences. 5. The Lord is My Shepherd (Negev) The Old Testament portrayal of God as shepherd has been lost in our culture. Rediscover the key to hearing the voice of God that guides us to fulfilled lives. 6. God with Us (Arad) In Old Testament times, God manifested himself in the temple. Today, he dwells in us. We have a responsibility to represent God's presence to a dying world.

These illuminating 'faith lessons' afford a new understanding of the Bible that will ground your convictions and transform your life. -- Church Volume Four Contents -- Part of a series previously published as That the World May Know, Faith Lessons on the Death and Resurrection of the Messiah focuses on the last week of Jesus' life, his death and resurrection, and the Holy Spirit's visit on Pentecost. 1. When Storms Come (Sea of Galilee) Just as Jesus stilled the storm, demonstrating his power over the natural world, so he also takes charge of our raging struggles. 2. Piercing the Darkness (Kursi) Kursi was believed to be the home of demons. There, in a deliberate choice to aggressively confront evil, Jesus healed the demon-possessed man. 3. Gates of Hell (Caesarea Philippi) In the center of this pagan city, Jesus declared, 'Upon this rock I will build my church,' challenging believers to boldly wage war on evil. 4. City of the Great King (I) (Jerusalem) 5. City of the Great King (II) (Jerusalem) When seen in the urban setting of Herod's first century Jerusalem, Jesus' actions and teachings come alive, sparking a deeper understanding of our faith's Jewish roots. Video Two 6. The Lamb of God (Mount of Olives) The significance of Passover celebrations and Passover Week events intertwine with Jesus' choice of time, place, and message. 7. The Weight of the World (Capernum/ Gethsemane) Manufacturing olive oil involves intense pressure. This process exposes a fresh perspective from which we can fully appreciate Jesus' sacrifice, which is our anointing. 8. Roll Away the Stone (Garden Tomb) Understanding the significance of Jesus' burial in a Jewish-style tomb and his resurrection during the Feast of First Fruits reveals the magnitude of his love and the new life he brings. 9. Power to the People (Southern Stairs) The day of Pentecost marks the day when God's presence left the temple structure to dwell in his followers -- empowering us today, as then, to change the world. 10. Total Commitment (Caesarea) David built fame out of simplicity; Herod's palace fortresses were elaborate. But as with David, who lived for God, what matters most is not what we build, but for whom we build.

God is there, the Scriptures tell us&#x97;on every one of them. But the ease with which he may be found varies from one page to the next. In this six-session Zondervan Groupware&#x99; video curriculum, award-winning author John Ortberg serves as guide and interpretive leader for experiencing the presence of God in everyday life. With his engaging and humorous style, Ortberg transforms our view of God&#x92;s presence from one that may seem hidden or distant to one that is closer than you think. The curriculum kit is designed for churches to use as a spiritual growth campaign. It includes a sixsession small group participant&#x92;s guide, a six-session DVD (with a thirty-two&#x96;page leader&#x92;s guide) featuring John Ortberg teaching, a CD-ROM (with sermon resources and promotional materials), and one copy of the hardcover book.

NOOMAs are appropriate for personal and small group settings, congregational meetings, and much more. Like parables, they use the experiences of our lives to teach about the fullness of life through Jesus, tackling issues like forgiveness, discipleship, and unconditional love. The study materials accompanying each NOOMA encourage meaningful discussion with relevant questions and biblical references.

He inspired, challenged, provoked, comforted, and invited people to be open to God&#x2019;s work in the world. Wherever he went, whatever he did, Jesus started discussions about what matters most, because for Jesus, God is always inviting us to open our eyes and join in. NOOMA is a series of short films that explore our world from the perspective of Jesus. NOOMA is an invitation to search, question, and joint the discussion. Why is it that often when we get what we want, we still feel empty? We work so hard to succeed, but our lives just end up becoming more about us. Can success turn on us? Can we get caught up in a smaller world where our lives are all about the things that we want? Or is there another way to live? Where life is about more than just us. Where we see people in need and we do something about it. Where our world is expanding because we are sharing our success.

Today is the day you choose...which game you want to win...which prize you want to collect...which priorities you want to set. It's a thrill to win at checkers or Clue or Trivial Pursuit. You sweep aside the other players and you 'own' the board. It's also a thrill to win a promotion at work ... the new house you wanted ... that sports car you've always eyed. But just like the game cards, the tokens, and the timer, those prizes are temporary. When the game is over, they all go back in the box. Games can cast a powerful spell, says bestselling author John Ortberg. But the wisest player remembers that the game is always going to end. So when everything goes back in the box, you'll have made what is temporary a servant to what is eternal, and you'll leave this life knowing you've achieved the only victory that matters. When the Game is Over, It All Goes Back in the Box will teach you to: * Live passionately and boldly * Learn how to be active players in the game that pleases God * Find your true mission and offer your best * Fill each square on the board with what matters most * Seek the richness of being instead of the richness of having This DVD is designed for use with the companion Participant Guide (sold separately).

Do you ever wonder, &#x201C;If Christianity is supposed to be so great and Jesus&#x2019; death was supposed to take care of everything, why is my life so messed up?&#x201D; It is only when we drink deeply from the life and death of Jesus---understanding the main events of his death---that we can find a full life. These studies (along with 'The Life of Jesus') invite us to see the behind-the-scenes truth of the main events of Jesus&#x2019; death---so that his death can affect our lives...today...right where we live...in the midst of our weaknesses and failures. With maps and pictures, outlines, key scripture verses, discussion questions, plenty of room for note taking, and a personal five-day Bible study for each session, this participant&#x2019;s guide will help you get the most out of The Life of Jesus, both in your group and in applying what you learn to your life. TAKE A DEEPER LOOK The Deeper Connections series is unique. Unlike any other Bible study available, this visually stunning DVD series is written and taught by biblical experts---six professors with specialized areas of knowledge. Don&#x2019;t let the word deeper scare you. These engaging and accessible studies are for everyone who wants to deepen their understanding of God&#x2019;s Word and apply it more faithfully and effectively. In fact, a full one-third of each study is centered on modern application of Jesus&#x2019; life and teachings. Hosted by Margaret Feinberg, who introduces each session from Israel, and filmed in locations as diverse as the Rocky Mountains, the Arizona desert, downtown Chicago, and Little Rock, Arkansas, each volume consists of six fascinating sessions. Each session is taught by a different teacher and emphasizes three components: 1. Historical and cultural background 2. An engaging, close look at the biblical text and its meaning 3. Accurate, encouraging, and challenging applications of the Bible&#x2019;s message to life today Are you seeking more from your Bible study? With three hours of teaching per DVD by Bible professors who know how to communicate the world of the biblical text to today&#x2019;s world, &#x201C;Deeper Connections&#x201D; will provide the depth for which you have been looking. Through alternating sections of teaching and group discussion or individual reflection, this Bible Study series will allow you to make DEEPER CONNECTIONS with three main areas: 1. Historical Background: Jewish, Old Testament, historical, social, and cultural backgrounds, along with New Testament parallels, will be examined in order to bring out the full and deeper meaning of the biblical text. 2. Biblical Text: Bible professors who teach this subject matter in Bible colleges and seminaries will teach the biblical text. This is not a study filled only with entertaining stories. It gets at the real meaning of the text through stimulating teaching. 3. Real-life Application: Challenging and accurate applications that come directly out of the biblical text will help you to live the truth of the Bible in today&#x2019;s difficult world.

Do you ever wonder, 'If Christianity is supposed to be so great and Jesus' life was so perfect, why is my life so messed up?' It is only when we drink deeply from the life of Jesus---understanding the main events of his life and teachings---that we can then be rescued. These studies (along with 'The Death of Jesus') invite us to see the behind-the-scenes truth of the main events of Jesus' life---so that his life can affect our lives...today...right where we live...in the midst of our weaknesses and failures. With maps and pictures, outlines, key scripture verses, discussion questions, plenty of room for note taking, and a personal five-day Bible study for each session, this participant's guide will help you get the most out of The Life of Jesus, both in your group and in applying what you learn to your life. TAKE A DEEPER LOOK The Deeper Connections series is unique. Unlike any other Bible study available, this visually stunning DVD series is written and taught by biblical experts---six professors with specialized areas of knowledge. Don't let the word deeper scare you. These engaging and accessible studies are for everyone who wants to deepen their understanding of God's Word and apply it more faithfully and effectively. In fact, a full one-third of each study is centered on modern application of Jesus' life and teachings. Hosted by Margaret Feinberg, who introduces each session from Israel, and filmed in locations as diverse as the Rocky Mountains, the Arizona desert, downtown Chicago, and Little Rock, Arkansas, each volume consists of six fascinating sessions. Each session is taught by a different teacher and emphasizes three components: 1. Historical and cultural background 2. An engaging, close look at the biblical text and its meaning 3.

Biblical Text: Bible professors who teach this subject matter in Bible colleges and seminaries will teach the biblical text. This is not a study filled only with entertaining stories. It gets at the real meaning of the text through stimulating teaching. 3.

It can only be received as a free gift compliments of God&#x2019;s grace. It doesn&#x2019;t cost anything, but it demands everything. It demands that we go &#x201C;all in,&#x201D; a term that simply means placing all that you have into God&#x2019;s hands. Pushing it all in. And that&#x2019;s where we get stuck&#x2014;spiritual no man's land. We&#x2019;re afraid that if we go all in that we might miss out on what this life has to offer. It&#x2019;s not true. The only thing you&#x2019;ll miss out on is everything God has to offer. Participants will find Batterson&#x2019;s teaching filled with his customary vivid, contemporary stories as well as biblical characters like Shamgar and Elisha and Jonathan and . . . Judas.No one has ever sacrificed anything for God. If you always get back more than you gave up, have you sacrificed anything at all? The eternal reward always outweighs the temporal sacrifice. At the end of the day, our greatest regret will be whatever we didn&#x2019;t give back to God. Eternity will reveal that holding out is losing out.The message ofAll Inis simple: if Jesus is not Lord of all then Jesus is not Lord at all. It&#x2019;s all or nothing. It&#x2019;s now or never. Kneeling at the foot of cross of Christ and surrendering to His Lordship is a radical act of dethroning yourself and enthroning Christ as King. It&#x2019;s also an act of disowning yourself. Nothing belongs to you. Not even you.Batterson says, &#x201C;For many years, I thought I was following Jesus. I wasn&#x2019;t. I had invited Jesus to follow me. It&#x2019;s a subtle form of selfishness that masquerades as spirituality. That&#x2019;s when I sold out and bought in. When did we start believing that the gospel is an insurance plan? It&#x2019;s a daring plan. Jesus did not die just to keep us safe.

Pastor Bill Hybels's firm conviction is that the highest value in personal evangelism is being attuned to and cooperative with the promptings of the Holy Spirit. This means playing only the role one is intended to play---walking when the Spirit says to walk, talking when the Spirit says to talk, and falling silent when the Spirit suggests that you've already said enough. According to Hybels, the goal for every Christian is to reflect Christ's love and follow his example by taking simple walks across rooms, leaving one's circles of comfort and extending hands of care, compassion, and inclusiveness to people living far from God. The DVD includes four video sessions that expand on the teaching from Hybels's book of the same name, as well as personal testimonies of lives transformed by the Holy Spirit.

It&#x2019;s easy to package that commitment with big ideas like picking a college, a spouse, and a career -- and then to never quite get around to it. God, however, posts no minimum age on discipleship, and his book contains several examples of younger people both willing and able -- in his power -- to do extraordinarily difficult and necessary things with their lives for him. Why Not Now?, by Mark Matlock, shares stories from the young lives of Miriam, Joseph, David, Solomon, Daniel, and Mary to find why and how they said yes to God before they would have been old enough to rent a car in our modern society. All six of these people believed God could use their lives to do something that mattered. What is holding us back? By looking at those stories, along with those taken from modern spiritual role models, we can learn how to break the cycle of procrastination and dedicate our lives sooner rather than later.', 'title': "Why Not Now?

Today's culture often defines 'bridge building' and reconciliation as a one-way street that leads to full theological, political and social agreement. Yet Christ demonstrated a different path of religious and cultural engagement to establish his kingdom here on earth. In light of such countercultural principles, the Christian community needs a new view on the issues that divide conservative believers and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities. Andrew Marin uses practical applications he's learned over the last decade of living and working in the LGBT neighborhood of Chicago (Boystown), as well as his international speaking and consulting ministry, to offer a variety of practical teaching, insights, and life-lessons on reaching the LGBT community. Rather than avoiding the topic of homosexuality, Love Is an Orientation aims to equip the Christian community to bridge the gap between LGBT and religious communities. Instead of discussing how to 'fix' gay people, this small group bible study is all about getting to know them, engage them, and love them like Jesus does. After this study, you, your small group and your church will know what it means to peacefully and productively build bridges with the LGBT community. This DVD is designed for use with the companion Love is an Orientation Participant Guide (sold separately). It features six 10 to 15-minute video sessions with Andrew Marin and other real-life stories that will spark discussion and equip you with tools to reach out to the LGBT community in love and understanding.

{'asin': '0578046725', 'categories': [['Movies & TV', 'TV']], 'description': 'Product Review: Video: Backyard Food Production Systems For a Backyard or Small Farm, by Michael Z. Williamson By James Wesley, Rawles on October 29, 2010 2:44 PM   Backyard Food Production Systems For a Backyard or Small Farm is a great video and useful resource. Not only is it based on a lot of research, but on more than a decade of home farming in central Texas, which is certainly one of the tougher environments in America to farm in. Very clearly narrated and demonstrated. It s a little handheld and shaky at the beginning, which emphasized the small scale involved, but professionally filmed and edited after the intro. This is a farm for a family of four, run very efficiently and productively. It starts with a chapter on the most important aspect: Water. Subjects include collection and distribution, with some welcome attention to cleaning often overlooked in other publications. Rainwater, gray water, well and commercial water sources are all covered, with extensive discussion of catchment and cleaning of rainwater. Ponds and catfish are mentioned, too. The chapter on gardening covers critical issues such as shade mapping, soil types, compost production, including safe composting of human waste. The narrative is quick and clear, and mentions lots of documents, helpfully provided on Disk 2. Rabbits. Raising and butchering rabbits I d recommend adding a gut hook and shears to the demonstrated method, but it s good to learn how using just a basic knife. This section is professional and clean, but the killing and butchering of a rabbit is probably not something to show children who are not familiar with the realities of meat. Also covered is how to use the rabbit waste for compost, and the rabbits are fed off shade trees and garden waste, for a very efficient cycle. The chapter on poultry is almost exclusively about chickens, kept free range for eggs. While chickens are certainly edible themselves, the eggs provide a much more efficient source of protein and are useful for cooking or trading. Here again, the chickens serve another purpose, eliminating ground insects and weeds and providing fertilizer. Dogs are useful, even essential to protecting a garden from the predations of wildlife. There s a good discussion of socializing and raising them to respect the human and keep paws off the other animals. Perennials include fruit trees. It s important to work with fruits that thrive in the area, not try to force commercial crops to fit. Geese make a good adjunct to an orchard, providing fertilizer and winter eggs. The chapter on Essentials covers calorie rich foods, such as grains and tubers, natural pesticides, first aid, contour mapping and covers how to check imports (hay and other composts) for toxicity. There are summaries at the end of each section. Each chapter has great tips on saving power and resources by nesting and stacking various plants, animals and tools to minimize waste, labor and costs. Overall, it s very clear. It seems a little chaotic in spots on a first viewing, but there s a lot of inter-related information here that has to be covered. It s worth watching several times and keeping as a reference. In all, it was very watchable, very lively, and what a good documentary and summary instructional video should be. The second disk has the extensive documentation, references and recipes. There are sections on composting, companion planting for nitrogen fixing, acorn flour, tanning hides, soil amendments, processing of various plants for seed oils, root cellar construction, a solar food dehydrator, and various fruits that are uncommon these days, such as persimmons and pawpaws. I highly recommend this as an overview, aid and morale booster for anyone planning to do home gardening or farming to improve their sustainment and off grid capabilities. - S --SurvivalBlog.com on October 29, 2010 2:44 PMThis DVD has everything you need to know, from water collection, gardens, home butchering and more. Get the most important education that you will ever need. Alex Jone, host of Alex Jones Radio and TV Show. InfoWars.com --infowars.comUrban Survival DVD Review for Food Production Systems for a Backyard or Small Farm If you re thinking of growing your own food, you better know what you re doing. Farming is a skill set that s quickly being lost and forgotten with the new generation, and it s more important then ever to learn it now! Peak oil, resource depletion and the collapse of society is coming right around the bend and if you re not growing your own food now, you ll be multiplying the amount of suffering you and your family will experience when SHTF. Luckily it s not too late, and we have a great product for you, that will give you a great introduction to growing your own food. If you re interested in backyard food production, this is the DVD to get! whether you just want to have a few hens in your backyard or you re thinking of completely overhauling your property and implementing a completely self sustainable food production system, this DVD will have the information you need. I ve seen/read a lot of videos/books on homesteading and food production, and this DVD in my opinion is one of the clearest, no BS products out there. It definitely has our recommendation.  Food Production Systems for a Backyard or Small Farm is approximately 2 hours long with 9 chapter and numerous sub sections ranging in subjects like: water collection and treatment, garden logistics, rabbit and poultry raising and butchering, dogs, food forests, and much more. It s bookmarked and broken up in such a way that it s extremely easy to go back and review any particular subject. A single DVD is obviously not enough to teach you everything you need to know about farming which is why the DVD also comes with a CD loaded with .PDF documents covering the more advanced aspects of farming. There are 64 .PDFs and they cover a wide a range of subjects. This may not be the best product for advanced homesteaders and food growers, but this DVD is definitely the perfect product to start your journey into the homesteading, farming, gardening lifestyle. Marjory and her family have been growing their own food for many years and her experience shows with this well thought out, and articulate DVD that she s produced. I ll admit, it s a bit pricy, but worth every penny. Just read the amazon reviews and you ll know why this product has one of our highest recommendations. --Urban Survival Network.com', 'title': 'Food Production Systems for a Backyard or Small Farm', 'price': 47.0, 'salesRank': {'Movies & TV': 129959}, 'imUrl': 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61YNGSXGJVL._SX300_.jpg', 'related': {'also_bought': ['160774189X', 'B006U5SLDM', 'B000LAZDOC', '0973323396', '1602399840', 'B003TN8FPW', 'B002SATC22', '086571701X', 'B003GTQIIU', '1580080162', '160358370X', 'B003GDUWII', '1856230910', '1603584447', '1490544372', '1496092589', '1931498407', '1603580298', 'B0083K827C', 'B00FBXAFQA', '1463757360', '0989711102', '0908228082', 'B002SATC2C', 'B000LAZDOM', 'B002SATC2M', 'B006QAZQ66', '1599555107', '0988872536', '0865716668', '1580117104', '0908228015', '0964343398', '1608610896', '1603582908', '1882424581', 'B008EL0IZY', '3200029285', '1890132608', 'B001TEKK0G', '1890132276', '158017647X', '144033353X', '1603424563', '0882663917', '0942364058', '1603583998', '0963810928', '093003175X', '1603580816', '0615680682', '0960446400', '1479373273', '1612120059', '0962464805', 'B0030D834Y', '1482081210', '1493654055', '0882662902', '1570618402', '1604692707', '1486156363', 'B007WV05NW', '1612431291', '1603582894', '0486436098', '1603429697', 'B005YFGIZM', 'B0010X5JBG', '0615994458', 'B00HUDU1V8', '1481269933', '1492228362', '1612431151', '0964343363', '1603584382', '0988337924', '0615689493', 'B00A7DDLM4', '1462113435', '1605290831', '0966678311', '1612432263', '1591865484', 'B000LQMKDS', '1492192597', '1602392331', '1933392134', '1933392592', 'B00744WZ8U', 'B005WY9JUG', '0865717184', '1616086106', '1603425683', '1462110940', 'B000K28MI0', 'B00AMQGSCQ', '1615642358'], 'bought_together': ['1602399840'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['1602399840', '086571701X', '0973323396', 'B000LAZDOC']}}

His student audience was attentive throughout his presentations which, uniquely, also includes a deist-inspired mini-rap by the doctor on the meaning of life that explains the innate human desire for hoochie-koochie and mind-altering substances, and the hazards thereof, most deists, especially the organized ones, merely denounce as the devil\'s work.  About pot, for instance, the doc forthrightly states his opinion that it ought to be legal and that it\'s absurd that we\'ve reached the point in this incarceration-crazed country that one out of four persons locked up is locked up for a pot related offense.  But he also strongly emphasized to the young people looking on that marijuana is an energy drain and can be a major distracting force, especially in a young person\'s life.  Why do it, he demanded, when you\'ve got all that natural energy you\'ll live most of your lives wishing you had again?  The AVA gives Old Doc Nuralja\'s Teen Talk a big thumbs-up. --Anderson Valley Advertiser, January 26, 2000, Bruce Anderson, editorLOCAL PHYSICIAN TALKS TRUTH TO TEENSDr. Peter Keegan says kids need to hear real information about drugs and sex, and know that God exists too.  At first, you might think he\'s "marching to the beat of a different drum" as he "strums on the ol\' banjo" but Old Doc Nuralja knows just what he\'s doing.And he isn\'t teaching music.  He\'s being silly, acting goofy and generating interest among our youth.  Because one you get people\'s interest, "you have them hooked, and you can get your message across," said Old Doc Nuralja - also know as Dr. Peter Keegan of Ukiah.  "I like to simplify stuff that seems to scientific, or too complicating for regular folks, so that people can understand important messages they might not otherwise get," he noted.For all those concerned parents out there who want to do this but aren\'t sure how to approach these sometimes awkward subjects, Doc Nuralja may be your answer.  When asked, he will give presentations to youth groups, and his video can also be used as a teaching tool. --Ukiah Daily Journal, February 24, 2000, author Laura ClarkThe straight skivvy on God, death, sex and drugs, sandwiched with home-grown banjo, that\'s what Dr. Peter Keegan, aka Old Doc Nuralja, delivers in this live, professionally-produced video.  Before an audience of about fifty teenagers, using commonly understood terms, Old Doc tells it like it is.  Silly hat, jeans, plaid shirt, suede vest, and banjo on his knee, corny jokes always at hand, Old Doc dives in by dismantling the theory of evolution using physics, with special emphasis on the law of entropy ("Messiness always tends to increase in a closed system ... it takes an organizing energy to overcome entropy.") to prove the existence of a divine creator - one with a great sense of humor.  Then he moves on to human anatomy to demonstrate the miracles of our bodies as "superbly organized, magnificently designed, and engineered, and works in a way that is downright magical."  He ties it all together with Einstein\'s theory of relativity and Obiwan\'s description of The Force, then assures the kids that they are in good hands, and need have No Fear.Sound advice for us all, but essential wisdom for kids growing up in these times where everything is available to them.  Most adults will learn much from Old Doc\'s rap, but every teenager should have this information. This video is one good way to make sure they do.

Burnett uses vivid language and analogies to help you understand: Your buttocks are "jelly buns" (to let the abs do all the work), your belly balances a dinner plate, and your chest "knits" together as you raise your arms. Then she progresses into a demanding abdominal series with such descriptive names as "roll like a ball" (but be careful to protect a nest of birds on your belly), "spider legs," and "scissors." Your abdominals will scream! Burnett\'s instruction and language continue to make the technique explicit: She describes the roll-up as "peeling your spine off the mat," and then lowering down by "replacing it bone by bone," for example. All exercises work the abs and back, and some add thigh and buttock conditioning. The same workout is aimed at the beginning and intermediate Pilates exerciser--beginners do just a few of the exercises, then add on until you\'re doing them all.--Joan Price', 'title': "Hilary Burnett's MIND BODY MAT - Exercises in the tradition of J.

Perhaps more importantly, the film features shark research and conservation at work, and bravely faces the tremendous teeth of threats facing sharks worldwide. Excellent graphics throughout the film help highlight the usefulness of tagging to understand the habits of the sharks, threats to their survival as a species, and occasional subtitling underscores the points for those of us too intrigued by the animals to be paying attention to the fact that it is sharks that are threatened, and we are the top predator of the ocean.&#60;BR&#62; Featuring notable shark scientist- UC Davis Professor Peter Klimley PhD, and young Mexican biologist Mauricio Hoyo Padilla, we see shark science at work. The scientists explore the mysterious world of these animals from movements to dinner habits, and the graphics help translate the arcane into the exalted, and at times the dismal future sharks face. Admirably, the filmmaker does not shy away from taking on the greatest threat to pelagic shark populations worldwide, the rising popularity of shark fin soup, creating a demand for shark fins, and supporting the practice of shark finning; the killing of sharks for just their fins. Kudos to the filmmaker for not soft peddling this very serious issue that not only affects sharks, but the entire oceanic ecosystem of which they play an integral role. Sharks desperately need more films in this light.&#60;BR&#62; Educational yes, but excitement and information pepper this independently produced film and if it weren't for the subtle melodies scoring the film, one might subconsciously hear that familiar tum tum, tum tum we associate with circling sharks. Those of us intrigued by the Man in the White Suit with the cold black eyes and perpetual grin will not be disappointed by a lack of teeth and predatory attack. Tight shots, in focus details and ghostly long shots abound, and the haunting music accompanying the encounters paint a primal scene of intrigue and unearthly beauty.&#60;BR&#62; Films like this help us understand sharks, and with hope, reverse the perceptions of fear or hate, and help demystify the monster. Listed as threatened with extinction, lets hope we will learn to love the Great Whites Sharks before it is too late. The Island of the Great White Shark is a fin in the right direction. --David McGuire, WetPixel.com, Feb. 24, 2008Island of the Great White Sharkis interesting, engaging, and exciting as it tells a coherent story of the efforts to preserve great white sharks worldwide, with an emphasis on populations migrating to Isla Guadalupe, Mexico.

{'asin': '0615270778', 'categories': [['Movies & TV', 'Movies']], 'description': "Having lived in Alaska for more than 25 years I can honestly say that 'Barrow, Alaska: Our Tales to Tell' is excellent for learning about the North Slope Borough and the melting pot culture that it is today. Written and produced by Touch Alaska Interactive, Media, in my opinion, Our Tales is the single most knowledgeable overview of arctic life. Teachers, students and people seriously considering visiting or moving to the North slope will find Tales a realistic and practical beginner's overview of history, anthropology, geography and demographics. I recommend every public library and school district add this DVD to its media collection. Our Tales to Tell is excellent for contrasting the historical and mythical perception of what the 'Southern States' think of Barrow, Alaska in contrast to the modern, technologically advanced society it is today. Teachers interested in linguistics will be able to teach students that the narrators' voices and inflections are examples of two people from the same culture learning English at different times in their lives. The man's voice is easily identifiable as a person taught to think and read in English as his predominate language while the woman s voice and inflection is that of an I&#xF1;upiat having learned English as a second language while still thinking in I&#xF1;upiat. Teachers interested in anthropology and history will be able to use this DVD in chapters to teach students (of various ages) about absorption of subcultures into modern North American society. This DVD is a wonderful way for educators to teach how the I&#xF1;upiat Eskimos have incorporated ancient traditions into the modern world. Students will be interested, if not fascinated, by the visual presentation, but will find the pace of the film a bit slow and may perceive some of the narration somewhat below their age (therefore, un-cool) and grade level. Teachers may need to prep older students about their behavior to keep the class from having side-conversations [Using the linguistics narrative differences as an instructional experience will be a useful way to keep the older students on task.] The beautiful and some stark visual images both historical and modern are the outstanding presentation value of this film. The narration is factual and informative. In sum, I would purchase this DVD for my personal library. More importantly, as a teacher I will use this DVD in my own classroom instruction for the very purposes stated above. Professional Criticism: For young students ages between late second grade and fourth, it is a bit too long to show without breaking it up into instructional units using the DVD chapters. Teachers could easily make a week-long instructional unit on northern Alaska Native culture. Some sections of the DVD are more sophisticated and appropriate for older students (6th through 12th) and adults. However, the photographs visual film are universally age appropriate. Overall Opinion of DVD for educational purposes: Generally for all grades, people considering moving to the arctic and tourists: visually A ; practical & informative value A ; narration, music and pacing; B. For Grades 2nd through 4th: visually A ; overall B+ (using the DVD in chapters and units of instruction) because information narration may be too sophisticated for some young students. Grades 5th through 9th: visually A ; Narration s simplicity & soothing music [may be perceived as un-cool], C+ , however practical and & informative value is generally A . For Teachers of cross-cultural learning, geography, history and anthropology: visual impact A; Practical & Informative value A ; Narration & music music B- . A skilled educator can bring this DVD to a lively and memorable classroom experience. --Review by S.

The film begins with remarkable nest-building close-ups; the soft fiber bird home rests on the Carroll's porch clothesline in Las Vegas. Inventive 360-degree macro shots follow the progress, including egg development, incubation, hatching, feedings, nest defense (including chasing away the Carrolls' cat), and first flight. Honey's protective and attentive mothering is enlivened through Noriko Carroll's informative and humorous narration and rich musical soundtrack.

An estimated 30 million Americans experience back pain at any given time, so if you\'re not suffering back or neck pain, chances are, some one close to you is. Many seek relief through surgery, medication and physical therapy. For many, self-help has a great appeal for those who\'d like to learn to relieve pain at home without costly professional treatment and reliance on medications. In this follow-up to the well received book Back Together- Hands on Healing for Couples, Dr. Andrew Kirschner is proud to release a comprehensive program - Back Together- Simple & Effective Back Pain Relief for Couples. In this fun and effective DVD program, Dr. Kirschner uses beautifully shot video to demonstrate sixteen hands-on techniques to be done with a partner.

Or is it fundamental to the universe, where the material world somehow arises from pure consciousness? From the perspective of quantum physics, are we both observer and observed?

The phenomenon of consciousness raises countless questions, but one thing is certain: consciousness is the most profound mystery we face as self-aware, thinking beings.

Among his dozens of books are the National Book Award winner The Book of the Dun Cow, and his bestseller The Book of God. His visit held special meaning for me since I was his writing student as an undergrad at Valparaiso University. But it was significant for another reason. It was the first viewing of the short film based on Wangerin s short story/parable, Ragman, directed by one of St. Louis best indie film-makers, Dale Ward. Since it first gained popularity in the mid-80s, the powerful story of the Ragman has had a viral history, even before the Web gave us the term. One can track its circulation in church newsletters, sermons, dramas, discussion groups, and online.

{'asin': '0615422853', 'categories': [['Movies & TV', 'Movies']], 'description': "Change Your Mind, Change Your BodyA few years ago, I bought a dress for a New Years Eve party. It was form fitting, short, covered in aqua sequins. It wasn t the kind of dress I'd normally wear more like something I'd imagine Marilyn Monroe in but some friends and I were planning a festive event in a loft in Manhattan. For the party, I wanted to be the type of person who wore that dress. Only problem was, it was a little bit snug. It would not forgive a few pounds put on over the holidays in fact, it would prefer a few less pounds.So throughout that fall and early winter, every time I put a piece of food into my mouth, I thought about that dress. I didn't diet, or feel deprived. Instead, I felt excited, and made very careful choices. If a holiday cookie wasn t super-delicious, I didn't finish it. I didn't eat if I wasn't hungry, and stopped when I felt full. By the time New Year's Eve rolled around, I had actually lost a few pounds! The dress and the party were both exactly as I'd imagined.Without realizing it, I was applying something known as The Law of Attraction, which posits that you can attract things into your life by thinking about them. So by picturing myself in that sequined dress, my mind caused me to adopt behaviors that made it possible to actually wear the dress.While trendy books likeThe Secrethave espoused this philosophy for years, there is actually some basis in science for a mind-over-matter approach. It's not just your thoughts: The very words you choose could be helping or hindering your weight goals, says Matthew B. James, MA, Ph.D., president of Kona University and an expert in ancient Hawaiian forgiveness and meditation techniques. &#34;We need to rethink our approach to labeling what we do,&#34; James says. &#34;I no longer say weight loss because I don't want to find it again. If you lose something, you are most likely going to find it! Think of something that you have lost, like your keys, your cell phone. What happens? You find it.&#34;Instead, James suggests &#34;weight reduction,&#34; or even better, &#34;weight donation.&#34; &#34;It feels good to donate, so go ahead and do it,&#34; James says, &#34;I'm sure that, somewhere in the universe, someone could use a little extra weight. So donate it and reduce it.&#34;James is one of the featured speakers in a new documentary called &#34;The Inner Weigh&#34; focused on The Law of Attraction and how to apply it to weight donation. The movie draws suggests a three-step process to defeat inner demons and imagine your way to a better body, denoted by the acronym FIT: Face yourself, Imagine yourself, Trust yourself.I have to admit, I was skeptical when I started watching the film, but it won me over with its positive, inspiring message. Most of the speakers have had their own struggles with weight, and their sincere you-can-do-it-too delivery made me want to be a healthier person.What the film said made sense if you continue to think of yourself as unathletic, or as someone who finds solace in cookies and chocolate, you'll remain on the couch, soothing yourself with bonbons after a rough day. Try thinking of the person you'd like to be, and what choices that person would make.I would like to be the person who fits into that sequined New Year's Eve dress again. Turns out that person really enjoyed soup and a salad for lunch today, and is happy drinking water instead of juice or soda. I'll keep you posted. --Jeanne O'Brien Coffey, Editor - New England Health AdvisoryEndorsed by Michael Beckwith, star ofThe Secret!The Inner Weighprovides factual evidence that the physical form is shaped by one s inner consciousness. --Michael BeckwithThis film offers a wise alternative to faddish products and instead supports the viewer in transforming --Neale Donald Walsch, author ofConversations With God", 'title': 'The Inner Weigh', 'price': 19.95, 'salesRank': {'Movies & TV': 228927}, 'imUrl': 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fWCJ2N-lL._SY300_.jpg', 'related': {'also_bought': ['0976801566', '1451641214', '078686222X', '1401938906', '158270399X', 'B003UN6JNQ', '1624671802', 'B005U0ZP46', '0977622215', '1572246766', '006081618X', '0981536328', '098905943X', '1478156805', '1590799771', '1401944582', '1401931871', '0684843463', '1419618474', 'B000K8LV1O', '1401921531', 'B0006UEVQ8'], 'bought_together': ['0976801566'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['0976801566', 'B00D1G9REA', '078686222X', '0062515802']}}

Though there are perhaps no better authorities on the matter than they, the fact of the matter is that absolutely nobody on this planet, other than DeFeo himself, knows exactly what went down on that night, and the fun of all this is that we never truly will. Though it's the most comprehensive and extensive piece of filmmaking ever made about that night, one that pretty much has me convinced that everything stated in it is in fact everything that really happened, I again must reiterate that we will never know the full truth, and nothing but the truth, and as such, the documentary must be watched with that in mind. What makes the case so compelling is that we won't ever find out the truth, and Shattered Hopes is merely a string of theories that shed a whole lot of light on many things about the case that were kept out of the public eye, in favor of the much more sensationalized tale of a bearded derelict possessed by the devil. So while it may not represent the 100% truth, it is perhaps as close as we've ever come to that truth, which is really what makes it such an important piece of true crime history. What I really like about it is that Katzenbach never definitively tells you &#34;Hey, this is exactly what happened&#34;, but rather he presents us with as much information as possible, and leaves us to discuss it, think about it, and form our own opinions. I can guarantee that you will form your own, after experiencing it. I could sit here and basically repeat everything I said about Part 1 back in January, but at the risk of boring you, I'll just say that everything I said about Part 1 also applies to Part 2, an equally compelling documentary that taught me a whole lot about the case, and exposed me to crime scene photos and documents that my eyes had never before laid on. In fact, a lot of the stuff presented in this part is being heard and seen here for the very first time. As in, anywhere. Part 2 is absolutely exhaustive in its coverage, taking us from the time the police arrived and started wheeling out bodies to the time Ronnie DeFeo decided to go for that whole insanity plea, presenting several possible theories to explain who was in the house at the time of the murders, and exploring the strong possibility that DeFeo did not act alone.

Throughout her life of devotion, Hildegard experienced visions from God that called her to express herself through her many talents and assume a role of leadership inside the church - one that challenged the male-dominated establishment and moved some to silence her. Accompanying herself on authentic medieval instruments, Linn performs Hildegard's original songs and, through the mystic's actual writings, embodies the life and passion of an extraordinary woman who lived centuries ahead of her time. Written and performed by Linn Maxwell Based on the stage performance directed by Erv Raible.

{'asin': '0736040773', 'description': 'For many years, various health care professionals have disagreed about the treatment of spine-injured athletes at the scene. How should protective athletic equipment, such as chin straps and helmets, be managed? When can the equipment be removed? What is the safest way to immobilize and transport the athlete?Because each health care group has its own protocols, there have been no standard guidelines for managing a suspected spine injury on the field and avoiding secondary injury&#8212;until now.TheSpine Injury Management Videois an important and visual reference that provides new information on treating spine-injured athletes and demonstrates step-by-step strategies for ideal care. These techniques can be applied to injured athletes in a variety of sports including football, lacrosse, soccer, and gymnastics.This video is based on the landmark report &#8220;Prehospital Care of the Spine-Injured Athlete: A Document From the Inter-Association Task Force for Appropriate Care of the Spine-Injured Athlete.&#8221; Led by the National Athletic Trainers&#39; Association (NATA), the task force consisted of representatives from more than 30 emergency medical associations and sports medicine organizations in the country. In this report, the group presents a uniform protocol for the appropriate management of suspected spine injuries. Most important, it provides guidelines for helping professionals avoid improper care that could result in secondary injuries. These sound guidelines have been recommended by many representatives of various health care specialties including the NATA and physicians&#39; and emergency medical service organizations.TheSpine Injury Management Videotakes you from the field to the trauma center to demonstrate how athletic trainers and emergency professionals respond and apply these new guidelines to spine-injured players. The video vividly drives home the correct procedures for proper start-to-finish management of the scene, covering many areas:-Who should provide prehospital care of the injured athlete-Initial assessment-Tools and techniques for protective athletic equipment removal-Safe immobilization and transportation-Care for suspected catastrophic spinal injury and appropriate prevention techniques Fortunately, injuries to the spine are relatively rare in athletes. However, when they do occur, there are no second chances&#8212;they must be treated promptly and correctly. With this video, you&#39;ll get expert guidance in developing a sound emergency response plan, deepen your understanding of the mechanisms of injury, and learn strategies to prevent injuries.The video is also an ideal training tool for increasing your staff&#39;s skill and instilling in them the confidence to carry out their vital roles in the care, supervision, protective athletic equipment removal, and transportation of the injured athlete.The video can also be purchased as part of a kit that includes instructor&#39;s materials on CD-ROM, a palm card and a poster.

It teaches that sex is a beautiful aspect of His intention for man and woman within marriage--any other sexual activity, whether premarital sex or homosexuality, goes against God\'s design and is destructive to their souls.Two 30-minute bonus segments highlight the uninterrupted testimonies of former homosexuals, Michelle Robinson and Mike Ensley. Their stories are sure to move hearts and connect with the life experiences of students who have same-sex attractions.The Question of Homosexualitywas specifically designed as a resource for youth groups, campus ministries and families in an effort to ground students in the truth about homosexuality while moving their hearts to compassion for their gay-identified peers.', 'title': 'The Question of Homosexuality DVD: A Conversation for Youth About Same-Sex Attraction', 'price': 11.75, 'salesRank': {'Movies & TV': 110522}, 'imUrl': 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PKCA0oCDL._SY300_.jpg', 'related': {'also_bought': ['0736912010', '0736914706', '0736911790', '0736925074', '0736912118'], 'buy_after_viewing': ['0736916911', '0736912010']}}

Alas, the rest of theButt-o-weentape features more standard B&B; escapades, none of which are related to Halloween. Highlights include thePleasantville-style parody "Leave It to Beavis" (in black and white, natch), the sublimely stupid "Ding-Dong Ditch" (B&B; ring doorbells and run, with varying degrees of success), and the almost-existential "Killing Time," in which the boys must occupy themselves for two hours until the next cool TV show comes on. However, you might want to fast-forward through "The Pipe of Doom" (Butt-head caught in a construction-site pipe), "Late Night with Butt-Head" (the boys do David Letterman), and "Candy Sale," despite a cameo voice appearance by David Spade in the latter. Still, "Bungholio: Lord of the Harvest" makes up for any letdown you might experience.--Mark Englehart'}

Seems he has always disliked seeing polar bears in captivity, but forever believed himself too young or too old to do anything about it--until now. Based on the children\'s story by Harry Horse, this animated version ofThe Last Polar Bearscaptivates from the moment "Dear Child" appears over the opening scene in which the smiling Grandfather and his canine compatriot Roo sail to the Arctic aboard their rather weathered boat. Gentle music accompanies the equally supple voice of Nigel Hawthorne (Oscar nominee fromThe Madness of King George) who, as Grandfather, tells this story through narrated letters to his grandchild. It\'s a tough journey--lasting well beyond the "32nd of October"--but one touched by many moments of joy and humor. Crisp, detailed characters (mostly animals) are set against dreamy watercolor backgrounds. The emotion and wonder of the 30-minute film\'s beautiful ending will surely touch young (starting at age 4) and young-at-heart-viewers in a lasting way.--Liane Thomas', 'title': 'The Last Polar Bears [VHS]', 'imUrl': 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415BHG25ZXL._SY300_.jpg', 'salesRank': {'Movies & TV': 559481}, 'categories': [['Movies & TV', 'Movies']]}

Only "The Method,"  (a hilarious combination of dance, song, visualization, and group  therapy) can help Baby Bear on such short notice. The result is 40  minutes of ABC\'sSesame Streetstyle, where vibrant educational  cartoons, enthusiastic kids, famous guest stars (here, Billy Joel), and  harmonizing Muppets make lasting educational impressions. Children ages  2 to 6 will enjoy the upbeat musical numbers dedicated to various  letters; a favorite segment features the Boogie Woogie Piggies and  their flashy rendition of the alphabet song. Throughout the well-paced  show, Big Bird offers just the right blend of coaching and friendship,  much like the ace support-group leader he\'s mildly spoofing.

When Ernie finds and returns a misplaced key,  he uses his knowledge of numbers to return the key to the correct  guest. As Ernie begins to learn about the hotel business, he finds many  common situations in which counting is essential. Throughout the  30-minute video, Ernie and his friends help children learn to count  from 1 to 20 with such songs as the jazzy "That\'s How the Numbers Go,"  an original version of theChorus Lineshow tune "One," and "Rap  Song #11." Favorite Sesame Street characters Elmo and the Count are  joined by new characters including Ding the Dinger, a furry fellow with  a bell on his head, and Benny, the bellboy that responds to Ding the  Dinger\'s dings. Children as young as 18 months will bounce happily  along with the catchy tunes, and 2-year-olds will be inspired to count  aloud with Ernie. Kids up to age 5 will hone their counting skills and  laugh at the increasingly frustrated Benny as he delivers everything  from 1 bucket of ice to 15 stampeding elephants!

At the time of Buckley's ascendance in the mid-'90s, both his high-flying vocal attack and his edgy poetic sense struck older listeners as genetic markers from his father, folk-rock legend Tim Buckley. Yet Buckley fils pursued a much more electric, rock-ribbed style, nodding toward behemoths like Pearl Jam and even Led Zeppelin.This 1995 concert is a single, complete show from the tour that yielded the posthumousMystery White Boylive album. It likewise impresses, both for Buckley's own songs and the bold cover choices included, here including songs associated with Nina Simone and the MC5 (a range that explains the emotional epics that Buckley favors).Visually, the unadorned lighting scheme casts an often harsh light on the pale, dark-haired frontman, but a generally solid performance is sonically captured with satisfying detail, and the 5.1 surround sound mix gives the DVD version an appropriate club ambience. The DVD also includes two bonus acoustic performances.--Sam Sutherland"}

The workout has great music (unlike a few of Smith's previous videos), provided by a live band at the Conga Room in Los Angeles, and a lot of infectious energy from Smith and her core group of fellow dancers. Whether this works as a workout for you, though, will depend on how quickly you can absorb dance steps. In fact, it's unlikely to get your heart rate up to decent workout levels, unless you're a fairly accomplished dancer used to throwing yourself into the steps. The tape includes a very brief warm-up, and then segments that essentially teach steps like the cha-cha, the samba, and the merengue, followed by a few minutes of cool-down. Because the steps aren't strenuous per se, there aren't two workout levels provided, as in most of Smith's tapes. Included is a bonus segment for you and a partner, to teach you how to take the steps onto the dance floor of your favorite salsa club.--Anne Hurley", 'title': "Kathy Smith's Latin Rhythm Workout [VHS]", 'price': 3.94, 'salesRank': {'Movies & TV': 403521}, 'imUrl': 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HWTTN3H5L._SY300_.jpg', 'brand': '', 'categories': [['Movies & TV', 'TV']]}

Once again, Elmo\'s on the move--this time to share important tips about respecting the family pet. The final episode examines life on the farm. Viewers will observe youngsters accomplishing daily farm chores as well as Muppet farmers and barn animals punning around. As Elmo bops around his house (simply drawn and "furnished" with color crayon sketches), he chats with Dorothy the pet goldfish, poses questions to Mister Noodle, and tunes in to his friendly television for helpful cartoons presented by "The Baby Channel," "The Dog Channel," and of course, "The Farm Channel."

{'asin': '0738921947', 'description': 'In this animated prequel toThe Wizard of Oz, the Cowardly Lion  (Jason Priestley) is a circus animal in Nebraska taken on an after-hours balloon  ride by the kindly Oscar (Dom DeLuise). The balloonist puts the souvenir "badge  of courage" around the lion\'s neck before the excursion goes awry in a storm and  the pair are separated. They both set down, of course, in the Land of Oz. The  Wicked Witch of the East (Lynn Redgrave) finds the lion in short order,  confiscates his badge, and forces him on a quest to find the Flower of Oz, a  mystical tool that would give her control of the realm. He is joined on his  journey by a girl named Wimsik (Jane Horrocks ofLittle Voices), her doll  and soldier toys (Kathy Griffin, Tim Curry), and a springy oddity named Silly  (Bobcat Goldthwait).Based on a book written by Roger S. Baum, great-grandson  of L.&nbsp;Frank Baum, who authored the classic Oz books, this 71-minute film  features professional performances, serviceable songs, and pleasant animation.  Devoted fans of the classic film and books may resent this obvious  capitalization, but kids will love the fun voices, playful new characters, and  easy-to-digest plot--not to mention the chance meeting at the film\'s end with a  certain party traipsing down a yellow brick road.

Cinderelmo (he\'s a boy, if you didn\'t know) dreams of playing in a castle and meeting the princess (Keri Russell). Unfortunately his mean--but not that mean--stepmother (Kathy Najimy) wants her two other sons to go to the ball at which the princess must declare whom she wishes to marry.The film is certainly focused on the youngsters (as opposed to the slightly older audience of the Muppet films), but there are plenty of puns and wry humor for adults to enjoy. The handful of songs are quite pleasant, as is the length (50&nbsp;minutes). Oliver Platt (as a new "fairy godperson") and French Stewart (as Cinderelmo\'s dog-turned-footman) enjoy their roles with relish. Appearing in various small roles are plenty of theSesame Streetgang, including Grover, Kermit, Cookie Monster, Bert, and Ernie. Great fun.--Doug Thomas'}

In the same way, WallBuilders seeks to energize the grassroots today to become involved in strengthening their communities, states, and nation. David is the author of numerous best-selling books, with the subjects being drawn largely from his massive library of tens of thousands of original writings from the Founding Era. He also addresses well over 400 groups each year. His exhaustive research has rendered him an expert in historical and constitutional issues and he serves as a consultant to state and federal legislators, has participated in several cases at the Supreme Court, was involved in the development of the History/Social Studies standards for states such as Texas and California, and has helped produce history textbooks now used in schools across the nation. David was named by Time magazine as one of America's 25 most influential evangelicals, and he has received numerous national and international awards, including Who's Who in Education and DAR's highest award, the George Washington Honor Medal. His work in media has merited several Angel Awards, Telly Awards, and the Dove Foundation Seal of Approval.
